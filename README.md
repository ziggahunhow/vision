Vision API with Nodejs
Learning how to use google's vision api with Node

Prerequisites:
You will need a service account, and Google gives a google starter's example here:
https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/libraries

Installing:
Simple as running a npm install

Notes:
If you are a beginner like me, make sure to create a 1) .env file to store the port and credentials. 2) Also don't forget to get the key.json file from Google as the token to use the service, but .gitignore it of course. 3) Lastly create a test_images folder to store temporary images.
